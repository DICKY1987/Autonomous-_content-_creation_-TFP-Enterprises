## PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE SETUP (Execute Now)

### Step 1: Environment Preparation
```bash
# Execute these commands in sequence:

# 1. Create project structure
mkdir -p black_history_content_system/{config,data/topics,data/sources,templates,scripts,logs}
cd black_history_content_system

# 2. Install all dependencies
pip install moviepy wikipedia-api requests gtts pydub pillow openai google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 edge-tts sqlite3

# 3. Verify FFmpeg installation
ffmpeg -version || echo "Install FFmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html"
```

### Step 2: File Creation
**CRITICAL**: Save all the provided code files with exact names:

1. Save the historical figures database as `data/topics/historical_figures.json`
2. Save the configuration as `config/black_history_config.json`
3. Save the research engine as `scripts/historical_research_engine.py`
4. Save the script generator as `scripts/historical_script_generator.py`
5. Save the QA system as `scripts/historical_qa_system.py`
6. Save the main system as `main_historical_content_system.py`
7. Copy the original `automated_content_system.py` and `upload_system.py` to the project root

### Step 3: Configuration Setup
Create `.env` file:
```bash
# Optional but recommended for higher quality
PEXELS_API_KEY=get_free_key_from_pexels.com
YOUTUBE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=youtube_credentials.json
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
```python
# Run this test to verify everything is working:
python -c "
from scripts.historical_research_engine import HistoricalResearchEngine
from scripts.historical_script_generator import HistoricalScriptGenerator
from scripts.historical_qa_system import HistoricalQualityAssurance
print('âœ… All modules loaded successfully')
"
```

```

### Quality Control Protocol

#### Automatic Quality Gates
The system has built-in quality controls:

1. **Historical Accuracy Gate**: Must score â‰¥95%
2. **Cultural Sensitivity Gate**: Must score â‰¥90%
3. **Educational Value Gate**: Must score â‰¥80%
4. **Language Appropriateness Gate**: Must score â‰¥85%

#### Manual Review Triggers
Content will be flagged for manual review if:
- Any inappropriate language is detected
- Sensitivity score < 90%
- Historical accuracy < 95%
- Educational value < 80%

#### Review Process
When flagged content appears:
1. Check `logs/historical_content.log` for details
2. Review `qa/facts_report.json` in project folder
3. Examine the generated script for issues
4. Make necessary corrections before proceeding

---

## PHASE 3: CONTENT OPTIMIZATION

### Topic Selection Strategy

#### Priority Categories (Focus Order):
1. **Freedom Fighters** (Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth)
2. **Underground Railroad Heroes** (William Still, Levi Coffin)  
3. **Intellectuals & Writers** (Phillis Wheatley, David Walker)
4. **Inventors & Innovators** (Benjamin Banneker, Norbert Rillieux)
5. **Religious Leaders** (Richard Allen)

#### Content Calendar Suggestions:
- **Monday**: Freedom Fighters & Abolitionists
- **Wednesday**: Intellectuals & Writers  
- **Friday**: Inventors & Innovators
- **Rotate**: Underground Railroad & Religious Leaders

### Script Quality Enhancement

#### Key Script Elements to Monitor:
1. **Person-First Language**: "enslaved person" not "slave"
2. **Historical Context**: Always provide era context
3. **Dignity & Respect**: Emphasize humanity and achievements
4. **Educational Value**: Clear learning outcomes
5. **Contemporary Relevance**: Connect to modern lessons

#### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Overgeneralization ("all slaves did...")
- Inappropriate terminology
- Missing historical context
- Lack of agency attribution
- Oversimplification of complex topics

## PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE MONITORING

### Daily Success Metrics

#### Quality Indicators:
- **Accuracy Score**: Target â‰¥95%
- **Sensitivity Score**: Target â‰¥90%
- **Educational Value**: Target â‰¥80%
- **Production Success Rate**: Target â‰¥90%

#### Production Tracking:
```python
# Check daily performance:
python -c "
from main_historical_content_system import HistoricalContentBusinessSystem
system = HistoricalContentBusinessSystem()
summary = system.get_production_summary(7)
print(f'Weekly Stats:')
print(f'Videos: {summary[\"total_videos\"]}')
print(f'Quality: {summary[\"average_quality\"]:.2f}')
print(f'Categories: {list(summary[\"categories_covered\"].keys())}')
"
```

### Database Monitoring
Track progress in SQLite database:
```sql
-- View recent content production
SELECT figure_name, quality_score, sensitivity_score, approved, created_at 
FROM content_production 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- View daily metrics
SELECT * FROM daily_metrics ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 7;
```

## PHASE 5: TROUBLESHOOTING & OPTIMIZATION

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "No Wikipedia page found"
**Solution**: 
1. Check `search_terms` in historical figures database
2. Add alternative names/spellings
3. Verify historical figure name accuracy

#### Issue: "Content failed sensitivity review"
**Solution**:
1. Review `logs/historical_content.log`
2. Check script for flagged language
3. Update `historical_script_generator.py` respectful language guidelines
4. Re-run production

#### Issue: "Low quality images"
**Solution**:
1. Add Pexels API key for higher quality images
2. Update `image_keywords` in figures database
3. Add more diverse search terms

#### Issue: "Video assembly failed"
**Solution**:
1. Verify FFmpeg installation
2. Check available disk space (need 2GB+ free)
3. Restart system and try again

### Performance Optimization

#### Speed Improvements:
1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple figures in parallel
2. **Caching**: Cache Wikipedia results for 24 hours
3. **Image Optimization**: Pre-download common historical images

#### Quality Improvements:
1. **Enhanced Research**: Add more trusted historical sources
2. **Better TTS**: Use premium text-to-speech for clearer narration
3. **Visual Enhancement**: Add historical timelines, maps, document images

## PHASE 6: SCALING & EXPANSION

### Adding New Historical Figures

#### Research New Figures:
1. Verify historical accuracy with multiple sources
2. Ensure sufficient documented information
3. Add to appropriate category in `historical_figures.json`

#### Required Information per Figure:
```json
{
  "name": "Full Name",
  "birth_year": YYYY,
  "death_year": YYYY,
  "primary_achievement": "Brief description",
  "key_facts": ["Fact 1", "Fact 2", "Fact 3", "Fact 4"],
  "search_terms": ["name", "alternative names", "nicknames"],
  "content_angle": "Unique hook for content",
  "educational_value": "high/medium/low",
  "sensitivity_notes": "Special considerations"
}
```

### Content Distribution Strategy

#### Multi-Platform Optimization:
1. **YouTube Shorts**: 45-second educational videos
2. **TikTok**: Focus on younger audience, trending hashtags
3. **Instagram Reels**: Visual storytelling emphasis
4. **Facebook**: Longer descriptions, community discussion

#### Hashtag Strategy:
```
Primary: #BlackHistory #Education #History #Learning
Secondary: #AmericanHistory #CivilRights #Freedom #Heritage
Specific: #HarrietTubman #FrederickDouglass #UndergroundRailroad
Platform: #Shorts #Reels #Educational #TikTokLearning
```

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### Content Quality Failure
If sensitivity/accuracy scores drop below thresholds:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Stop all content production
2. **REVIEW**: Examine recent content for issues  
3. **CORRECT**: Update guidelines and systems
4. **TEST**: Run small batch before full production
5. **RESUME**: Only after validation

### System Technical Failure
If technical errors prevent production:
1. **CHECK**: Verify all dependencies installed
2. **LOGS**: Review error logs for specific issues
3. **RESTART**: Restart system components
4. **FALLBACK**: Use manual content creation if needed
5. **ESCALATE**: Get human assistance if unresolved

### Historical Accuracy Concerns
If accuracy questions arise:
1. **PAUSE**: Stop production of related content
2. **RESEARCH**: Verify with multiple academic sources
3. **CONSULT**: Reference reputable historical institutions
4. **UPDATE**: Correct database and regenerate content
5. **DOCUMENT**: Log corrections for future reference
